# A Clone-Website on Pima Community College
This website deals with the generic stuff required for a college admission, it's a community college so some processes may vary.

As a part of an internship, we are assisted to design a clone for a website. Many of the members have choosen popular websites and applications for this task. But, Iam a learner yet, so I have decided to start with a smaller one.
I have started designing web pages, and it was as easy as we go into the process, then I have decided one thing to make it easier and faster, just love the process. Put your entire effort into it.
